## GA4GH TES

- To create a task, users need `create` access to resource `/services/workflow/gen3-workflow/tasks` on service `gen3-workflow`.
- To view a task, users need `read` access to resource `/users/<user ID>/gen3-workflow/tasks/<task ID>` on service `gen3-workflow`.
  - Users are automatically granted access to `/users/<user ID>/gen3-workflow/tasks` so they can view their own tasks.
  - Admin access (the ability to see _all_ usersâ€™ tasks instead of just your own) can be granted to a user by granting them access to the parent resource `/services/workflow/gen3-workflow/tasks`.
  - This supports sharing tasks with others; for example, "user1" may share "taskA" with "user2" if the system grants "user2" access to `/users/user1/gen3-workflow/tasks/taskA`.
