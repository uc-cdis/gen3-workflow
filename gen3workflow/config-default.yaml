#################

# When Gen3Workflow runs on an EKS cluster, it relies on IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)
# to provide AWS permissions to Funnel’s worker and executor pods.
#
# The parameters below are required for Gen3Workflow to:
#   - Identify the Kubernetes namespace where worker pods run, to construct the correct IAM role trust relationship
#   - Fetch cluster's OIDC provider URL based on the given cluster name and region
#
# In short: these values allow Gen3Workflow to generate per-user IAM roles that EKS will recognize and associate
# with the corresponding service accounts used by Funnel pods.
